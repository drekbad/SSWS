Stupid Simple Web Scanner - simplifying specific checks against web servers for initial information gathering

Starting off with search for WPadmin.php
- will add checks for other CMS
- option to search for potentially interesting robots.txt entries, especially if they ellude to WP or other CMS or details about hosting provider, etc
